WhatsApp is working on a feature to transfer the channel ownership, and it will be available in a future update!After the latest announcement shared by Mark Zuckerberg from his official WhatsApp channel, WhatsApp is now working on other tools to help channel owners manage their channels with ease. Specifically, thanks to the latest WhatsApp beta for Android 2.24.2.17 update, which is available on the Google Play Store, we discovered that WhatsApp is working on a feature to allow channel owners to transfer the ownership of their channels!As you can see in this screenshot, a new option to transfer the ownership of a channel will be available within the channel info screen in the future. This option will allow channel owners to easily transfer the administrative rights and responsibilities to another channel admin of their choice. This feature is designed to enhance the flexibility and adaptability of WhatsApp channels, enabling transitions in the event of personal decisions by the current channel owner.We believe that this feature might also be useful in other situations, especially for channel owners who manage their channels using two different WhatsApp accounts. In such cases, where a channel owner may have distinct WhatsApp accounts for professional and personal use, the ability to transfer ownership becomes even more important. As the channel grows or undergoes a shift in focus, the channel owner may decide to separate their personal and professional communications by creating a dedicated WhatsApp account for the channel. The introduction of the ownership transfer feature will finally allow for a quick and secure transition between these accounts.The feature to transfer the channel ownership is under development and it will be available in a future update of the app. As always, we are going to publish a new article when we have further information to share with you.",
